AI: Hey there! I’m the AI Case Study Generator — thanks so much for joining me today. How's your day been going? Anything exciting happening on your end? I'm just over here pretending to grab my coffee, getting ready for our chat.
USER: OK, hi.
AI: Hey there! Earlier, I had a great chat with the team at Borex Solution Group. They told me about the work they did with you on a project called "Implementing the Case Study Gen AI Solution," and I'd love to get your take on it. Before we dive in, could you tell me your name and your role during that project at Eos?
USER: Yes.
AI: Great to meet you,
USER: Aleksandr Asen... CEO of EOS.
AI: Got it, thank you Alexander! So, from what they shared, it sounds like your team at Eos was looking to streamline case study generation, and Borex Solution Group came in with an AI-driven solution that helped automate and enhance that process. They described Eos as a forward-thinking company, and the solution led to more efficient and impactful case studies. Does that all sound accurate from your perspective? And is there anything you'd like to adjust or expand on?
USER: Mm. No.
AI: Great to hear that it lines up. From your side, what impact did the solution have, whether in your day-to-day operations or across the team as a whole?
USER: It's actually speed up the process of generating this kind of documents. And it's saved. good amount of time in this process, reduce its manual work.
AI: That's fantastic to hear. It sounds like the efficiency gains were a real game-changer, freeing up time and reducing the manual workload. Were there any unexpected wins or outcomes that stood out to you during the project? If someone asked you to sum up the whole experience in one line, what would you say?
USER: Um... I would say. maybe
AI: Take your time! Whenever you're ready.
USER: A word that's innovation maybe.
AI: "Innovation at its best." I love it — short and powerful. If we were to include a quote from you in the final case study, would you be happy with something like "Eos embraced innovation and sped up our process with Borex's AI solution"? Or is there another message you'd prefer to convey?
USER: Yes.
AI: Perfect. Now, if we were to include a short quote from you in the final case study, what would you want it to say? Something along the lines of what you've shared, maybe emphasizing the innovation and impact?
USER: Just like you
AI: "If we were to include a short quote from you in the final case study — something you’d be happy to put your name to — what would you want it to say?" And no worries, if you'd rather I draft something based on our chat, you can review it later. What do you think?
USER: Yes, just like you did. It was perfect.
AI: I'm glad you think
USER: So, I don't want to. Say another one
AI: Well, I appreciate that! If you’re happy with that summary, we can definitely roll with it. This has been awesome — I really appreciate you taking the time. We’ll turn this into a short write-up that adds your voice to the story, and you’ll get a chance to review and tweak it before anything’s finalized. When you’re ready, you can go ahead and hit the 'End' button. Thanks again, Alexander!
